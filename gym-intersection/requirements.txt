Welcome to our simple intersection simulator. 

You will need:
    - gym
    - mathplotlib
    - numpy

Running tests.py ($ python ./gym-intersection/tests.py) will:
    - Create a random agent with a blank intersection. The agent's Q-table is random. 
    - Test the agent on that intersection, show a graph (before.png) and average car wait time during the test.
    - Train the agent on a few hundred thousand episodes, graphing along the way (during.png).
    - Test the intersection again, there will be some improvement over the first test. The Q-table is taken from the training directly and the intersection is created randomly; therefore not testing on training data. The second test will graph as after.png.
